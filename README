A first (unfinished) foray into web programming/Google App Engine: Live.fm allows users to find live music near their current location using the Last.fm web API.

Written in Python using Google App Engine.
Returns information about events at a given location from either:
	Internal cache (Not implemented yet)
	Last.fm API

Development info - Server/.pydevproject - The {GOOGLE_APP_ENGINE} path variable may have to be modified to point to your google_appengine folder.  This can be done in eclipse by right-clicking on the Server project and going to 'PyDev - PYTHONPATH'/'String Substitution Variables'.  After modifying the file, tell git to not track any more changes to the file by running 'git update-index --assume-unchanged Server/.pydevproject'
