Live.fm allows users to find live music near their current location using the Last.fm web API.

The Live.fm source has two main components: the server and the client.

Server:
	Written in Python using Google App Engine.
	Returns information about events at a given location from either:
		Internal cache (Not implemented yet)
		Last.fm API
	
	Development info - Server/.pydevproject - The {GOOGLE_APP_ENGINE} path variable may have to be modified to point to your google_appengine folder.  This can be done in eclipse by right-clicking on the Server project and going to 'PyDev - PYTHONPATH'/'String Substitution Variables'

Client:
	Written in Java using the Android SDK.
	Displays the user's current location on a map and events near the user.
